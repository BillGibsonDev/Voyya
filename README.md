# Voyya

Voyya is a model company that suggests to its users/subscribers vacation ideas.

Project using Google Maps API and Facebook/Instgram API

Overall goal is to make a slideshow using Google Maps Locations displayed on the webpage that when placed on a suggested landmark to display images from that location. 

After completion of website design and concept I want to recreate this into a similar mobile app using Google Maps API that routes you through a "suggested tour" OR
have the user customize their own routes/tours.
